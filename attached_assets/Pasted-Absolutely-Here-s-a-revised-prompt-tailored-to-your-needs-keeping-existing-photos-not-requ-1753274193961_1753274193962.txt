Absolutely! Here's a revised prompt tailored to your needs — **keeping existing photos**, **not requiring Firebase**, and **including all Kenyan coffee varieties, grades, and growing regions**:

**Prompt for Replit AI Web Builder:**

---

Revamp this coffee export website for **GEODE Coffee**, a Kenyan-based company sourcing and supplying high-quality, traceable coffee to global buyers. The site should remain static (no need for Firebase), and must retain the **existing photos**, while enhancing overall design, usability, and content structure. Apply the following upgrades:

---

### 🎨 Visual & Branding Enhancements

* Retain existing images but improve layout and framing for better aesthetic balance and text readability.
* Use a consistent color scheme: earthy browns, soft creams, and greens to reflect premium, natural, Kenyan coffee.
* Apply a stylish font pairing:

  * **Headings**: elegant serif like "Playfair Display"
  * **Body**: clean sans-serif like "Inter" or "Open Sans"
* Use generous padding and spacing to avoid clutter.

---

### ✍️ Content Structure & Clarity

Update all sections for better storytelling and professionalism:

#### Hero Section

* Headline: **“Kenya’s Finest Coffee — Traceable, Premium, and Straight from Origin.”**
* Subheading: **“Explore our wide range of Kenyan coffee varieties, grades, and regions. Perfect for global roasters and importers.”**
* Button CTA: “Request a Sample” or “Explore Our Coffees”

#### About Us

* Share the GEODE story: origins, mission, and your connection to Kenyan farmers.

Add a section titled **“Our Coffee Varieties”**:
List all key Kenyan coffee cultivars:

#### Coffee Grades Section

Add a section titled **“Available Grades”**, with descriptions:

* **AA** – Large bean size, excellent aroma and acidity.

* **PB (Peaberry)** – Rounder bean, concentrated flavor.

  * Country
  * Coffee interest (dropdown: Green Beans, Roasted, Sample, etc.)
  * Message
* Form can just use `mailto:` for now or simple static form handler like Formspree or Getform.

---

### 🧩 Functional Improvements

* Add responsive layout that looks clean and accessible on all screen sizes.
* Improve form UX: make fields clearly labeled and easy to use.

### 📈 SEO & Trust Building

  <meta name="description" content="GEODE Coffee sources and exports premium Kenyan coffee varieties like SL28 and Ruiru 11, across all major growing regions. Explore AA, AB, and Peaberry grades.">
  ```
* Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) to improve crawlability.
* Add alt text to all images, e.g., `alt="SL28 beans drying on raised beds"`

---

### ✅ Extras for Credibility

* Add a testimonials or partner section (even placeholder quotes help).
* Add a footer with:

  * GEODE Coffee name
  * Contact email and phone
  * Instagram or WhatsApp icon
  * “Proudly based in Kenya”

### Optional

* Add a toggle for dark mode (make sure existing photos still look good).
* Include a “Why Kenyan Coffee?” section with facts about altitude, rainfall, and soil.
* Optionally embed a downloadable catalog PDF or pricing sheet.

---

This version should look premium, communicate trust, and give potential coffee buyers the full scope of your offerings — all while staying static and lightweight. Let me know if you want this prompt tailored for WordPress or another platform!
